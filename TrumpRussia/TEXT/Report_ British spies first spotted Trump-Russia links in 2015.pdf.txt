The report said Britains Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) noticed suspicious interactions between Trump allies and known or suspected Russian agents in late 2015. The information was picked up amid routine surveillance of Russian targets and was not part of a spying operation aimed at Trumps team, the Guardian said. {mosads}Other foreign nations also reportedly shared intelligence about links between Russia and Trumps campaign, including Australia, Germany, France, Estonia and Poland. Trump claimed last month without evidence that former President Obama wiretapped Trump Tower. The White House pointed to Fox News commentator Andrew Napolitano, who claimed that GCHQ spied on Trump at Obamas behest. Fox briefly pulled Napolitano off the air after his report, and Foxs news reporters distanced themselves from his claim. GCHQ last month called Napolitanos statement utterly ridiculous. read://https_thehill.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fthehill.com%2Fpolicy%2Fnational security%2Fintelligence%2F328718 uk spies first saw trump russia ties report 1/1
