Well have to get back to you on that, Spicer said. Riiiiiight. I wont hold my breath. Since we arent likely to learn much from Team Trump about his tax returns, I figured Id dig deep and see what I think I know about them. (I say I think because Ive learned with Trump that you never know even what you think you know.) First, heres my list of what I know: 1. In 1978 and 1979, Trump reported negative $3.8 million in income and paid no taxes. We know that because of a 1981 gambling commission report in New Jersey that details Trumps income (or lack thereof) as reported in a casino application around that time. 2. In 1995, Trump reported that he lost $916 million   an amount that could have allowed him not to pay taxes for nearly the next two decades, according to the New York Times. 3. In 2005, Trump made $150 million and paid $38 million in taxes, according to documents obtained by investigative reporter David Cay Johnston. 4. His most recent returns are under audit, according to the White House. Spicer affirmed that fact on Monday. (Note: You can release your taxes publicly even if you are under audit. Richard Nixon did.) And thats it. Now, to the more speculative/educated guesses portion of this post. Heres what I think I know about Trumps tax returns. 1. Trump wont release them. Ever. From Trumps point of view, why would he? Hillary Clinton made Trumps tax returns and lack of transparency a major focus of her 2016 campaign, and he still won. Voluntarily releasing at this point is just not in the cards. The only way I can see Trump putting out the returns is if they are the only thing that can prove his lack of culpability in the Russia hacking scandal. And were not even close to there yet. 2. People say they care about Trumps taxes. But they dont vote on them. Most polls Ive seen show somewhere between 55 and 65 percent of people think the President should release at least some of his taxes. Two Republicans   Reps. Mark Sanford (South Carolina) and Walter Jones Jr. (North Carolina)   have signed on to a letter urging the relevant congressional committees to obtain copies of Trumps returns. The problem for people who want to see Trumps tax returns is that outside of the core Democratic base   not exactly Trumps target audience   people just dont cast their votes on the issue. If they did, Trump would have lost last November. 3. Trump made a calculation a long time ago that whats in the returns is worse for him politically than not releasing them. During the campaign, Trump used to say that no lawyer would advise any client to release their returns while under audit. OK. But those clients arent running for or serving as the President of the United States. The audit, therefore, has always felt like a veil hiding the real reason Trump didnt want to release the returns: Because they showed a) he wasnt as rich as he said, b) he didnt pay much in taxes, c) the the documents revealed some sort of blatant conflict of interest, or d) some other reason I havent thought of. read://https_www.cnn.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cnn.com%2F2017%2F04%2F18%2Fpolitics%2Ftrump taxes tax returns%2Findex.html 4/5 2/23/25, 10:11 AM 7 things I think I know about Donald Trumps tax returns | CNN Politics And heres one other thing I know: In refusing to release his tax returns, Donald Trump is the least transparent presidential candidate   and President   in at least four decades. And I also know this: He doesnt care at all. read://https_www.cnn.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cnn.com%2F2017%2F04%2F18%2Fpolitics%2Ftrump taxes tax returns%2Findex.html 5/5
