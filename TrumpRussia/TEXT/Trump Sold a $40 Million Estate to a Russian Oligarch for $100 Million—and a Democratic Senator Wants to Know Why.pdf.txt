"It is imperative that Congress follow the money and conduct a thorough investigation into any potential money laundering or other illicit financial dealings between the president, his associates and Russia," wrote Senator Ron Wyden, an Oregon Democrat, reported ABC on Friday. Wyden, who sits on the Senate Intelligence Committee that is investigating alleged collusion between the Trump camp and Russia, wrote that the transaction between Trump and oligarch Dmitry Rybolovlev is being probed by special counsel Robert Mueller. In the request, he notes the timing of the 2008 sale, which came months after Trump Entertainment Resorts filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, and while the then real estate mogul was struggling to find banks willing to lend to him. Trump has in the past attributed the markup to renovations he made to the property, which he snapped up when the previous owner filed for bankruptcy. read://https_www.newsweek.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newsweek.com%2Ftrump sold 40 million estate russian oligarch 100 million and democratic 802613 1/2 2/23/25, 3:00 PM Trump Sold a $40 Million Estate to a Russian Oligarch for $100 Millionand a Democratic Senator Wants to Know Why "What do I have to do with Russia?"
