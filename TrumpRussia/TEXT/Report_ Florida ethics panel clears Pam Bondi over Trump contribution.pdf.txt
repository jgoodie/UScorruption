Autoplay: On | Off A Florida ethics panel reportedly concluded behind closed doors that no probable cause existed showing Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi violated any state law when seeking donations from President Trump. The state ethics panel probed Bondi, a longtime supporter of Trump, in relation to her decision to seek tens of thousands of dollars from Trump nearly four years ago. The Associated Press reported that the panel endorsed the recommendations of an outside lawyer after an investigator also looked into several complaints. Bondi was personally interviewed as part of the probe, according to the AP.
