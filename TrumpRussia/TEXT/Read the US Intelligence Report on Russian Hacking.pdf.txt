The Office of the Director of National Intelligence on Friday released its declassified report on Russias efforts to influence the outcome of the 2016 election by hacking Democratic outfits during the campaign. The report comes a day after top intelligence officials, including Director of National Intelligence James Clapper and National Security Agency Director Michael Rogers, testified before the Senate Armed Services Committee on the issue.

On Friday, Clapper, Rogers, FBI Director Jim Comey, and CIA Director John Brennan briefed President  elect Donald Trump on the classified evidence linking Russia to the hacks and the leaking of the swiped emails.
