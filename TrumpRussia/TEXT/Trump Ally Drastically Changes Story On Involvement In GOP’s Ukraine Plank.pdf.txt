Gordon again disputed Diana Denmans version of events, and said reports that he has changed his story about his degree of involvement in the Ukraine amendment she proposed were a leap. I didnt change the platform nor did I say I did, Gordon said. Instead, Gordon recalled, he spoke privately with RNC national security subcommittee chairman Steve Yates during the meeting in which the amendment was discussed, and told him that language about providing Ukraine with lethal defensive weapons was a problem because it broke with Trumps statements on wanting improved relations with Russia and not wanting to go World War III over Ukraine. He said Yates told him they would have a robust discussion with delegates, and that was it. [CNNs] Jim Acosta took that to mean I pushed for the amendment, Gordon said. I mean, whats the definition of pushed for the amendment, right? Its an issue of semantics. Original story below: In a significant reversal, a Trump campaign official on Thursday told CNN that he personally read://https_talkingpointsmemo.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftalkingpointsmemo.com%2Fdc%2Fjd gordon change story gop platform ukraine amendment 3/5 2/23/25, 10:15 AM Trump Ally Drastically Changes Story On Involvement In GOPs Ukraine Plank advocated for softening the language on Ukraine in the GOP platform at the Republican National Convention, and that he did so on behalf of the President. CNNs Jim Acosta reported on air that J.D. Gordon, the Trump campaigns national security policy representative at the RNC, told him that he made the change to include language that he claimed Donald Trump himself wanted and advocated for at a March 2016 meeting at then unfinished Trump International Hotel in Washington, D.C. Gordon claimed that Trump said he did not want to go to World War III over Ukraine during that meeting, Acosta said. Yet Gordon had told Business Insider in January that he never left the side table where he sat monitoring the national security subcommittee meeting, where a GOP delegates amendment calling for the provision of lethal defense weapons to the Ukrainian army was tabled. At the time, Gordon said neither Mr. Trump nor [former campaign manager] Mr. [Paul] Manafort were involved in those sort of details, as theyve made clear. Discussion of changes to the platform, which drew attention to the ties to a pro Russia political party in Ukraine that fueled Manaforts resignation as Trumps campaign chairman, resurfaced Thursday in a USA Today story. The newspaper revealed that Gordon and Carter Page, another former Trump adviser, met with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak at the GOP convention. Trump and his team have long insisted that his campaign had no contact with Russian officials during the 2016 race, and that they were not behind softening the language on Ukraine in the Republican Party platform. Attorney General Jeff Sessions on Thursday recused himself from all cases involving the Trump campaign, after the Washington Post revealed that he failed to disclose during his confirmation hearing that he had two meetings with the Russian ambassador during the campaign. Michael Flynn also stepped down as national security adviser in a cloud of controversy over reports that he spoke with Kislyak about sanctions against Russia during the post election transition period. Gordon acknowledged meeting with Kislyak to both CNN and USA Today on Thursday, and said that the conversation focused only on Trumps oft stated belief that the U.S. and Russia should have a better relationship. He did not respond Friday to TPMs request for comment, but denied to Business Insider that there was any significant distinction between how he characterized his involvement in altering the Ukraine amendment in January and in March. The RNC and Nominees Campaign have the authority and responsibility to shape the GOP Platform, Gordon told Business Insider in an email, reiterating that Trump was not involved with the details. They werent part of the process to write, draft, edit the document, or weigh in with the delegates at all, he wrote about Trump and Manafort. That said, the overarching thought of better relations with Russia was certainly their strategic position. The watered down language that ultimately ended up in the platform called for the U.S. to provide appropriate assistance, rather than lethal weapons, to Ukraine to push back against Russian intervention.
