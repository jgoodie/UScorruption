Since the groups murderous Oct. 7 attack on Israel, U.S. officials have vowed to crack down on Hamass financial network just as Israel vows to eradicate it militarily, with senior Treasury Department officials traveling to Qatar, Saudi Arabia and Europe as part of a coordinated push to target the militant groups funding sources.

But the difficult work in crippling its networks remains unfinished. The Israeli Foreign Ministry has claimed that Haniyehs personal fortune is in the billions of dollars, though independent experts say there is no evidence to support that claim. Hamass financial resources contrast starkly with the vast poverty facing the people of Gaza, even before Israels military unleashed a devastating bombardment on the https://archive.ph/20231105164257/https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2023/11/02/hamas funding ismail haniyeh us sanctions/ 2/28 2/23/25, 2:26 PM Hamass vast financial network faces new U.S. scrutiny   The Washington Post territory in retaliation for Hamass Oct. 7 attack, in which more than 1,400 people were killed. It is unclear exactly how much Haniyeh knew about the attack, with experts divided over the extent to which Hamass political wing controls its military leadership, which is based in Gaza. The United States Treasury Department is laser focused today on dismantling Hamass financial networks, Wally Advertisement Adeyemo, the deputy treasury secretary, told the Royal United Services Institute, a foreign policy think tank, in London last week.  Hamas and associated terrorist groups have long sought to destroy Israel and attack those in the region and around the world that do not ascribe to their hate filled ideology. These groups need financial resources to help fuel their hate. To do so, they have developed ways to access or circumvent our financial systems. Through its heavy taxation of Palestinians in Gaza, with levies as high as 20 percent on imports, Hamas raises as much as $400 million per year, according to Matthew Levitt, a former Treasury Department official who is now the director of the Reinhard Program on Counterterrorism and Intelligence at the Washington Institute. The militant group has also stood up a vast investment portfolio that U.S. officials estimate is worth more than $500 million, and possibly as much as $1 billion, with assets in Sudan, Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Algeria and the United Arab Emirates, among other countries. In addition, the militant group receives as much as $450 million per year in black market smuggling fees, according to Daniel Roth, research director at United Against Nuclear Iran. The State Department has also said that Iran provides as much as $120 million to Palestinian groups including TOP STORIES Hamas, while experts estimate it also receives hundreds of millions from other international funding sources, including Qatar. Overall, Hamas spends roughly $1.6 billion on government operations in Gaza, according to Roth.

[ How Hamass carefully planned Israel attack devolved into a chaotic rampage ] On Oct. 18, Treasury announced sanctions on Hamas backers and financial facilitators that report to the Hamas political bureau overseen by Haniyeh. Experts said that even if the Gaza economy shut entirely, Hamas could still receive funding from Iran and its investment portfolio that could be Advertisement redirected to operations in the West Bank or elsewhere without U.S. action.

Blinken meets with Palestinian Authority president in first wartime visit to West Bank Treasury officials have repeatedly accused Hamass top leadership of enjoying lavish lifestyles outside of Gaza while average Palestinians suffer the consequences of the militant groups actions. Adeyemo, the deputy treasury secretary, said last week that much like many Russian elites, senior Hamas officials often live in luxury, while the average Gazan faces dire living conditions. Brian Nelson, Treasurys undersecretary for terrorism and financial intelligence, also said in an address last month that the investment portfolio allows Hamas officials to live in luxury, including elsewhere https://archive.ph/20231105164257/https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2023/11/02/hamas funding ismail haniyeh us sanctions/ 5/28 2/23/25, 2:26 PM Hamass vast financial network faces new U.S. scrutiny   The Washington Post in the Middle East, while ordinary Palestinians in Gaza face harsh living conditions and dire prospects. Treasury spokespeople declined to provide any evidence, however, supporting these assertions. Israels Foreign Ministry also declined to provide any evidence supporting its claim that Haniyeh and other top Hamas leaders are personally worth billions of dollars. Advertisement A Hamas spokesman also did not return requests for comment about Haniyehs personal wealth. Haniyeh has been able to run operations from Qatar because the United States and Israel have long tacitly endorsed his presence there, believing it is preferable to have Hamass leaders somewhere they can be monitored rather than somewhere, such as Iran, where they cant. The events of Oct. 7, however, seem to have complicated that arrangement in the eyes of some hawkish members of Congress, even as Qatar helps play a crucial role in negotiating the release of hostages held by Hamas. [ Israel says Hamas is ISIS. But its not. ] Israel imposes restrictions on the movement of Palestinians within Gaza, which makes it far more practical for Hamas leaders such as Haniyeh to live abroad. And while Gazans are suffering under Hamas rule, the Israeli bombardment and the war  which has seen nearly 8,800 people, including more than 3,600 children, killed, according to the Gaza Health Ministry  could strengthen the groups popularity. Historically, the political bureau for Hamas was moved abroad, and that is something they did for security tactics early on in response to targeted assassinations by the Israelis, said Tareq Baconi, board president of al Shabaka, a Palestinian think tank, and the author of a book about Hamas. Baconi also said while there is much resentment in Gaza toward Hamas over the current moment, it is important not to overstate the extent of a backlash. I think historically Palestinians in Gaza have also rallied around Hamas at moments where it escalated its resistance because https://archive.ph/20231105164257/https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2023/11/02/hamas funding ismail haniyeh us sanctions/ 6/28 2/23/25, 2:26 PM Hamass vast financial network faces new U.S. scrutiny   The Washington Post they understand that is the only way for them to engage with the Israeli authorities and its apartheid regime. On Capitol Hill, pressure is already mounting for the United States to ensure that top Hamas leaders such as Haniyeh can no longer oversee the groups financial networks from the safety of Qatar. The administration should tell the Qataris that these guys should be handed over by the U.S. or Israeli governments. They shouldnt be able to stay there, said Rep. Juan Vargas (D Calif.), a member of the House Financial Services subcommittee on national security and illicit finance. The Qataris ought to make a choice: What side are you on, the side of terrorists or the side of the Americans? That choice should be forced upon them.

RhetoricRelief 2 days ago (Edited) I bet he is hard to get to   he knows he has a target on his forehead... So he will be protected and locked in a villa   it will take time to plan an operation to get to him it takes patience! But it will come! Right now his army is getting smoked! Things die down... And dude will just disappear... Also maybe they want him alive to be prosecuted... Who knows...  heftyroy 2 days ago This article is biased. Stein references ONE Palestinian man, who he declares without proof, is a billionaire and we're supposed to think his fortune was obtained illegitmately. There are an untold number of Israeli billionaires living all over the world with dual citizenship. How did they amass wealth? Subtext is important, especially when hidden.  Dazed n Confused 2 days ago Did you actually read the article, or just blurt out your own biases for the heck of it? "The Israeli Foreign Ministry has claimed that Haniyehs personal fortune is in the billions of dollars, though independent experts say there is no evidence to support that claim." That's what the article says. The author 'declared' nothing. This is called 'reporting the facts'. Secondly, Hamas is a terrorist group. Israel is not. Palestinians are living in poverty, while this ONE man (representing a terrorist group, supposedly in the interest of Gaza and Palestinians) is living in luxury. Israel is prosperous, in general, so of course there are many wealthy people. Forget about subtext....the facts are right in front of you. Read them.
