2/23/25, 9:08 AM Russia: Trump & His Teams Ties Russia: Trump & His Teams Ties Image Despite Russia's harmful national interests against the U.S., and its human rights violations around the world, President Trump and his team are directly and indirectly tied to Russia. Throughout the 2016 presidential election, President Trump not only refused to criticize Russian President Vladimir Putin, but was even friendly and accommodating in his remarks. In his own words, President Trump called President Putin "highly respected ." More recently, President Trump put the U.S. on equal moral footing with Russia when responding to Bill O'Reilly's question about Putin being a "killer," saying "We've got a lot of killers... you think our country's so innocent?" This is absolutely false moral equivalence, and unheard of for the President of the United States to insult and demean the country he leads. read://https_swalwell.house.gov/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fswalwell.house.gov%2Fissues%2Frussia trump his administration s ties 1/28 2/23/25, 9:08 AM Russia: Trump & His Teams Ties President Trump has harshly criticized NATO, and exclaimed that only the NATO allies that paid equally to the alliance deserved protection from the United States. Though these remarks were softened by British Prime Minister Theresa May, who claims that President Trump fully supports the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), it's still unclear how supportive he will be of NATO allies like the Baltic states in light of his relationship with Russia. President Trump has also surrounded himself with people who do business with and are sympathetic to Russia.

Manafort eventually signed a $10 million contract with Deripaska in early 2006. The Trump Administration and Manafort have both said that Manafort never worked for Russian interests. Since the FBI confirmed in a House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence hearing on March 20 that investigators are examining whether the Trump campaign and its associates coordinated with Russia to interfere in the 2016 election, the White House has made attempts to distance itself from Manafort, claiming that he played "a very limited role" in the campaign, despite his clear leadership role as campaign chairman leading up to the Republican National Convention. On October 27, 2017, Manafort was indicted by a federal grand jury for conspiracy against the United States, among other charges. read://https_swalwell.house.gov/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fswalwell.house.gov%2Fissues%2Frussia trump his administration s ties 11/28 2/23/25, 9:08 AM Russia: Trump & His Teams Ties Carter Page: Page, hired as a foreign policy advisor to Trump's 2016 campaign, was known to have deep ties to Gazprom, Russia's state owned gas company.

In January 2017, he met with a Ukrainian opposition politician and Felix Sater to discuss a plan to give Russia long term control over Ukraine and lift sanctions against Russia. They then put this plan in a sealed envelope and left it in the office of then National Security Advisor Michael Flynn. George Papadopoulos: Papadopoulos was a foreign policy advisor for the Trump Campaign. On October 27, 2017 it was revealed that Papadopoulos had plead guilty to making a false statement to federal investigators "about the timing, extent and nature of his relationships and interactions with certain foreign nationals whom he understood to have close connections with senior Russian officials." While working for the Trump Campaign, Papadopoulos met with an overseas professor who told him about the Russians possessing "dirt" on Hillary Clinton in the form of "thousands of emails." He repeatedly sought to use his connections to arrange a meeting between the campaign and Russian government officials. On March 31, 2016, at a foreign policy meeting with Trump and other campaign advisers, Papadopoulos shared that he could help arrange a meeting between Trump and Putin. He sent multiple emails to other members of the campaign about his contact with "the Russians" and "outreach to Russia." read://https_swalwell.house.gov/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fswalwell.house.gov%2Fissues%2Frussia trump his administration s ties 27/28 2/23/25, 9:08 AM Russia: Trump & His Teams Ties In addition to these ties, it appears that Trump and his team are conscious of their guilt. In late February 2017, CNN reported that "the FBI rejected a recent White House request to publicly knock down media reports about communications between Donald Trump's associates and Russians known to US intelligence during the 2016 presidential campaign." This request may be a violation of procedures that limits communications between the White House and FBI on pending investigations. Why is America's leader and his team so close to Russia? This is either due to poor judgement or a deeper personal, financial, or political link between President Trump and Russia. It is not normal for the leader of our country to be so extensively tied to a foreign government that has sought to undermine democracies across the globe, and connections like these should be concerning to American citizens everywhere.
