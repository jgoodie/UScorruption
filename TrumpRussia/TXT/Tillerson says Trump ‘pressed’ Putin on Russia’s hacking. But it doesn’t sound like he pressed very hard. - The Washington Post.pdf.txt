But it doesnt sound like he pressed very hard. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson spoke about the two hour meeting between President Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin on July 7. (The Washington Post) By Aaron Blake July 7, 2017 at 7:20 p.m. UTC The big question heading into Friday's meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin at the G 20 summit was whether President Trump would confront him about Russian hacking in the 2016 election. The answer was a resounding maybe. It depends, apparently, on how loosely you define confront. https://archive.ph/20210421125558/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the fix/wp/2017/07/07/tillerson says trump pressed putin on russian hacking but the evid 1/8 2/23/25, 8:54 AM Tillerson says Trump pressed Putin on Russias hacking. But it doesnt sound like he pressed very hard.   The Washington Post Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, who was present at the meeting, said afterward that Trump did indeed press Putin on Russian interference at multiple junctures. The president opened his meeting with President Putin by raising the concerns of the American people regarding Russian interference in the 2016 election, Tillerson told reporters. They had a very robust and lengthy exchange on the subject. The president pressed President Putin on more than one occasion regarding Russian involvement. MOST READ POLITICS Okay. Sounds pretty serious. But then Tillerson said repeatedly that the meeting was about the future and not the past. But I think what the two presidents  I think rightly  focused on is how we move forward, he said. Later, he would add that Putin's contention that Russian didn't hack represented an intractable disagreement and said, There was not a lot 1 Analysis Marjorie Taylor Greene and the implosion of the America First Caucus of re litigating things from the past.

The White House is quibbling  anonymously  with the idea that Trump accepted Putin's denial. And it certainly wouldn't be out of character for Lavrov and Russia to mislead; they have incentive to do so. But at this point, the White House and Trump haven't really given us much reason to doubt that Trump didn't really Todays Headlines press all that hard.

But it doesnt sound like he pressed very hard.   The Washington Post this issue, he equivocates, qualifies and deflects. He can't just say that he thinks Russia hacked and that it must be dealt with; he has to say that other countries probably hack too, he has to cast doubt upon the intelligence community, and he has to point the finger at President Barack Obama for not doing more. Case in point was Thursday during a news conference with Poland's president, when he did all of that. Trump has never been firm in his comments about Russian hacking, including at times labeling the whole thing a hoax and suggesting that it might have been some kid in his parents' basement rather than the Kremlin. There is basically nothing in the public record that suggests Trump would push back particularly hard if Putin just denied the whole thing. Indeed, that was the same position Trump used to have and almost seems to wish he could have again  if it weren't for all those politicians in both parties who are hugely worried about Russia. The White House is often asking us to believe that Trump is a different president behind closed doors  that hes a guy who might one day question the intelligence behind the Russia investigation and then the next day hold Putins feet to the fire on it. But thats asking everyone for a whole lot of suspension of disbelief. We'll have to see what else comes out about this meeting, but Tillerson's readout of it suggests that Trump pretty much just checked a box and moved on to other things  which perhaps shouldn't surprise any of us. Maybe Lavrov was lying! But if the Russians are giving an MOST READ inaccurate account of the meeting, perhaps Trump should say so publicly on this issue of such import. We'll hold our breath. More than anything, his failure to say much of anything tough publicly suggests that whatever he said behind closed 1 Tucker Carlson says protests intimidated Derek Chauvin jury into guilty https://archive.ph/20210421125558/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the fix/wp/2017/07/07/tillerson says trump pressed putin on russian hacking but the evid 4/8 2/23/25, 8:54 AM Tillerson says Trump pressed Putin on Russias hacking.
