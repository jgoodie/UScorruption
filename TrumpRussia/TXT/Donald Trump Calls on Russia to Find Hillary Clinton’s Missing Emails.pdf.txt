Sanger July 27, 2016 DORAL, Fla.  Donald J. Trump said on Wednesday that he hoped Russian intelligence services had successfully hacked Hillary Clintons email, and encouraged them to publish whatever they may have stolen, essentially urging a foreign adversary to conduct cyberespionage against a former secretary of state. Russia, if youre listening, I hope youre able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing, Mr. Trump said during a news conference here in an apparent reference to Mrs. Clintons deleted emails. I think you will probably be rewarded mightily by our press. Mr. Trumps call was another bizarre moment in the mystery of whether Vladimir V. Putins government has been seeking to influence the United States presidential race. His comments came amid questions about the hacking of the Democratic National Committees computer servers, which American intelligence agencies have told the White House they have high confidence was the work of the Russian government. At the same news conference, Mr. Trump also appeared to leave the door open to accepting Russias annexation of Crimea two years ago  which the United States and its European allies consider an illegal seizure of territory. That seizure, and the continued efforts of Russian aided insurgents to undermine the government of Ukraine, are the reason that the United States and its allies still have economic sanctions in force against Moscow. https://12ft.io/proxy 1/2 2/23/25, 9:53 AM https://12ft.io/proxy Donald Trump Calls on Russia to Find Hillary Clintons Missing Emails   The New York Times Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
