I think theres no stopping Elon Musk, Putin told Carlson after the pundit asked him about the growing prevalence of artificial intelligence. He will do as he sees fit. Nevertheless, youll need to find some common ground with him. Search for ways to persuade him. I think hes a smart person. I truly believe he is.

Musk has sparked controversy in recent months over his retooling of X, the platform formerly known as Twitter, and his embrace of antisemitic and other unproven theories. Musk, who owns several major media and technology companies, oversees a vast communications network that is crucial to Ukraines fight against Russia.

Carlson has also praised Musk for his handling of X, the platform on which the former cable news host launched his new show after being pulled off the air by Fox News last April. read://https_thehill.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fthehill.com%2Fhomenews%2Fmedia%2F4457311 putin praises elon musk a smart guy%2F 1/1
