2/23/25, 8:50 AM Trump, Comey and the Russia investigation: What we know so far Trump, Comey and the Russia investigation: What we know so far The disclosure of a memo written by James B. Comey saying that President Trump had asked him to shut down the FBIs investigation of former national security advisor Michael Flynn followed months of intrigue. Trump has frequently belittled investigations underway into Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election. His comments, often on Twitter, have only heightened the suspicions of his detractors about Russias ties to Flynn and other senior Trump campaign advisors. Last month, Trump fired Comey. Democrats have accused the president of trying to obstruct the inquiry by ousting the man who had been heading it. The existence of a memo documenting private conversation between Comey and Trump, first reported by the New York Times, has set off widespread speculation that Trump could now be vulnerable to impeachment. Heres a timeline on the drama that has unfolded since Trump won the Nov. 8 election: Nov. 8 Trump wins election Trump, defying polls, shocks the political establishment and beats Hillary Clinton to become the 45th president of the United States.
