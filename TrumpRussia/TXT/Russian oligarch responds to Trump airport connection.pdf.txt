(Palm Beach Daily News file photo) For the first time, Russian oligarch Dmitry Rybolovlev confirmed his plane and President Donald Trump's jet shared the tarmac in Charlotte five days before the general election, saying he was in North Carolina for a business reason. In addition, Rybolovlev through a spokesman reiterated he has never met the Republican billionaire despite buying the Maison de L'Amiti Palm Beach mansion from him nine years ago.  COMPLETE COVERAGE: Donald Trump in Palm Beach Particular attention has been focused on a trip made by Mr. Rybolovlev to North Carolina, said Sergey Chernitsyn, an adviser to Dmitry Rybolovlev. He was in North Carolina for a business meeting and we can state categorically that he did not have any contact with Mr. Trump or any of his advisers at the time he was there. Chernitsyn issued a statement to The Palm Beach Post after it reported Friday additional details surrounding Rybolovlev's purchase of a Palm Beach mansion from Trump in 2008 for $95 million  the largest price paid for a Palm Beach home at the time.

He tweeted in January, I HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH RUSSIA   NO DEALS, NO LOANS, NO NOTHING! and has repeatedly derided any news reports about links between his campaign and Russia as fake news. However, in February, Gen. Michael Flynn resigned as National Security Advisor after misleading the vice president about his meetings with Soviet ambassador Sergey I. Kislyak. Dmitry Rybolovlev Attorney General Jeff Sessions this month recused himself of any investigations into Russia after news reports that he failed to tell Congress during his confirmation hearing about two meetings with Kislyak. Speculation that Trump had been in contact with Rybolovlev was stoked when FAA records showed the oligarchs A319 grey and white jet landed in Charlotte just as the then Republican presidential candidate was visiting the area for a campaign rally in Concord on Nov. 3. Trumps plane arrived at Charlotte Douglas International Airport 90 minutes after Rybolovlev. The McClatchy News Services reported limousine companies and local luxury hotels in Concord didn't have any record of ferrying Rybolovlev. But the arrival of Rybolovlev's plane certainly made an impression. Even Trumps plane is not that nice, Mike Dockery, president of Concord Air Center, told McClatchy. It looks like a sheiks airplane. Dockery said the plane did take on fuel and his son saw a man leave on a golf cart from the oligarchs plane during its stay. Anna Catherine Sendikoski was at the airport when she saw Rybolovlevs blue and grey plane arrive, followed 20 minutes later by Trumps easily recognizable aircraft. It was just suspect to me, Sendikoski told McClatchy.It just seemed strange. read://https_www.daytondailynews.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.daytondailynews.com%2Fnews%2Fnational govt  politics%2Frussian oligarch responds trum 2/5 2/23/25, 2:55 PM Russian oligarch responds to Trump airport connection Credit: Jeffrey Langlois Credit: Jeffrey Langlois Donald Trump stands in front of 515 N. County Road, the estate he bought at auction for about $41 million, renovated and then sold in 2008 at a recorded $95 million. (Palm Beach Daily News file photo) The Trump Administration has called questions about the Concord event ridiculous and denied any member of the Trump campaign or family met with Rybolovlev at any time. "For a press corps so obsessed with evidence, proof and feigning a general disgust at even the hint of conspiracy, this is pretty rich," the White House told the website Business Insider. The plane, according to FAA records, also was in Las Vegas on Oct. 30 when Trump appeared at a nearby campaign rally. Another juxtaposition of Trump and Rybolovlev occurred just last month when the oligarchs plane landed at Miami International Airport while Trump was at Mar a lago on Palm Beach entertaining the read://https_www.daytondailynews.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.daytondailynews.com%2Fnews%2Fnational govt  politics%2Frussian oligarch responds trum 3/5 2/23/25, 2:55 PM Russian oligarch responds to Trump airport connection Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. Mr. Rybolovlev travels frequently to many different destinations, including destinations across the U.S., Chernitsyn said. If Mr. Rybolovlev was physically in the same place as Mr. Trump at any time, this was pure coincidence. Donald Trump purchased 515 N. County Road in 2004 and sold it in 2008 for a recorded $95 million. (Palm Beach Daily News file photo) Chernitsyn told The Post on Friday that reports using circumstantial evidence to support a relationship between Rybolovlev and Trump are simple speculation. None of these theories has any foundation in fact, he said. Mr. Rybolovlev has never met Mr. Trump personally and has no connection whatsoever to Mr. Trump or his team of advisers.
