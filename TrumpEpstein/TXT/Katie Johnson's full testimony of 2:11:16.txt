00:00:00.000 I came to this interview on my free will. No, there was nothing promised to me for  
00:00:04.620 doing this interview. Yes, everything that I say at this interview will be the truth.
00:00:09.540 I met Donald Trump at some parties that I was working for Mr. Jeffrey Epstein. There was  
00:00:22.740 about three or four times that I had encounters with Donald Trump. I was 13. The first time that  
00:00:30.810 I met Donald Trump was at a party at Jeffrey Epstein's mansion. We were he was --- there  
00:00:41.820 was an orgy going on, and he was kind of watching off in the distance. And and he basically asked  
00:00:55.800 if I could come over and give him give him a hand job. And at first I wasn't very comfortable with  
00:01:06.600 it this was like my first or second party, and I I didn't you know I didn't think that that was my  
00:01:12.270 responsibility, but my recruiter told me that I needed to do it so I agreed to and then he  
00:01:23.550 you know I said I said began to uh --- sorry this is a little difficult ---- but before I  
00:01:32.460 gave him a hand job he kind of slapped my hand away and said you need to use a glove. And the  
00:01:38.160 recruiter ran over and handed me a glove and said 'no one touches Mr. Trump's penis  
00:01:42.360 without a glove'. So I needed to use a glove. I gave him a hand job and then immediately after,  
00:01:51.240 you know, he he had an orgasm he left, and I didn't see him again at that party.
00:01:57.330 Jeffrey Epstein is a billionaire friend of Donald Trump's that was responsible for throwing the sex  
00:02:06.090 parties. There was --- I originally came to New York trying to be a model and in my travels I met  
00:02:15.310 a girl named Tiffany there who was very interested in me and said that you know she that's what she  
00:02:22.810 did is that she helped girls you know get what they wanted and and she could help me get it and  
00:02:27.310 get into modeling that she knew a lot of people that were that were higher ups and that it would  
00:02:31.840 be no problem. And so that's why you know she but I would just basically have to come model  
00:02:38.590 at a couple of events and meet some people. It would be no sweat. So of course I went you know  
00:02:45.130 that it sounded like no big deal. And she was recruiting the girls to come to these parties,  
00:02:54.250 and they all looked I mean most of them were near my age there was you know maybe  
00:03:00.520 a couple girls that were maybe 14 or 15 but it seemed to me like we were all very young so.
00:03:06.550 Jeffrey Epstein knew that I was 13 years old. When he interviewed me he asked me  
00:03:17.530 to get down to my bra my just my panties and I thought that was weird but I mean modeling  
00:03:23.380 maybe it was something about my figure and he asked that I give him a massage so he and then  
00:03:31.540 he asked me my age he asked me and I told him you know I've told him that I was 13 I told him  
00:03:35.920 why I was there and and he basically said well you'll do you know I'm sure that you'll you'll  
00:03:41.200 fit pretty nicely here and then he he tried to basically slip himself inside of me. And I  
00:03:50.890 pushed him away and I said I'm because ---- at that point in time I still believed that there  
00:03:55.870 was models and then there was the girls that did that like I thought there was a separation. So,  
00:04:00.970 um yeah I told him that I wasn't interested in that, but he said that I would do.
00:04:06.970 And as far as Donald Trump, he knew that I was 13 and I believe that Tiffany told him.  
00:04:14.140 He seemed to take a liking to me, because I was I was so young and I was also a virgin -- so,  
00:04:23.400 I don't know he's it seemed like he wasn't really into having having girls that that  
00:04:30.960 were liked by the other guys he kind of --- you know the whole glove --- and he kind of  
00:04:36.570 liked things to be his first you know if that for lack of you know better term,  
00:04:42.150 but he was the one who wanted to get to get to a girl before everyone else did.
00:04:50.760 Donald's Trump knew that I was 13, because the first the first night that I was there  
00:04:56.730 Tiffany actually suggested that, and she had a whole bunch of different wings than  
00:05:01.020 I expressed interest in them you know I always told her that I would love to walk  
00:05:04.290 around blue hair and so I tried some on and there was a blonde wig that she said  
00:05:10.740 that looked great on me so I wore that wig. And Donald Trump had specifically asked about me,  
00:05:17.760 because I remind him of his daughter and she said well she's 13 as well. So,  
00:05:22.680 he knew the first time that he saw me but he took a liking to me because I look like his daughter.
00:05:28.860 The reason I'm coming out now is when it happened originally I just wanted to  
00:05:36.180 forget about the whole incident and when I saw that he was running for President, I felt it  
00:05:42.900 was my responsibility to come out and tell our country what kind of man this person is. I don't  
00:05:50.910 think that he should even be the dog catcher let alone running the greatest country in the world.
00:05:56.580 After I met Tiffany at the bus station, she took me to basically went to her house her  
00:06:05.100 apartment and got ready I put on a blonde wig, because it seemed fun to pretend to be someone  
00:06:11.070 different but we went to the party that I was basically entering interviewing for.  
00:06:17.610 And Jeffrey Epstein was the one that was running the party. He had a quick meeting  
00:06:24.630 with everyone that was employed there, and he had a private interview with me.
00:06:33.050 The first time that I met Jeffrey Epstein he did try to force himself inside of me without  
00:06:41.000 getting the go-ahead or anything and then on the it was probably about the third or  
00:06:50.090 fourth party is when he basically forced it was it was another massage and it was  
00:07:01.490 basically like it wasn't sex but it was there was penetration and I told him that I didn't  
00:07:08.390 want that but he kind of got a little irritated so I don't know there was something about him  
00:07:14.300 that I guess I kind of held him like I helped a lot of resentment towards him.
00:07:22.760 By that time that that happened I I kind of already started catching on  
00:07:26.240 that maybe I wasn't there for modeling and maybe I was just  
00:07:28.790 getting used for things and I felt that kind of held him responsible.
00:07:32.750 Um I did receive money to go to these parties. After every party I was paid by Mr. Epstein.  
00:07:43.070 There wasn't --- out of all the girls that were there with me I never I've most of them  
00:07:50.780 were 13 14 I think the oldest one might have been 16 just but just turned 16. I mean she'd  
00:08:00.350 been there for a while. It was actually --- it was Tiffany he was it he was he he liked  
00:08:10.100 to watch but other people have sex I I mean it was must and he he's the germ doesn't like  
00:08:15.380 germs so he rather than partaking. He just watches so Tiffany I informed him that I was  
00:08:22.460 the virgin and so he was I was basically sorry I right so it was Tiffany who introduced us.
00:08:35.990 The second time that I saw Mr. Trump was same scenario he was on-looking so at an orgy and  
00:08:46.040 Tiffany came over to me and said that Donald Trump had requested that I perform oral sex on him. And  
00:08:55.700 never I'd never done something like that with anybody so I was a little nervous so I walked  
00:09:02.150 up to him and he was standing and saying they're very proud like and I just kind of moved to that  
00:09:11.090 direction and he's kind of slapped me away and said what are you doing you know you need to put  
00:09:15.650 a condom on like I was some like dirty filth or something without a condom. Tiffany ran over and  
00:09:23.300 handed him a condom -- me a condom and apologizing profusely and said that would never happen again  
00:09:28.640 that and she looked at me and scolded me being seemed kind of like a child and said that that's  
00:09:35.150 not how a Donald Trump always you know anytime you took it touched his penis it needs to have a  
00:09:39.170 condom on her glove you know you oh and especially when it comes to performing oral sex. So I'm I  
00:09:44.960 apologized and then I performed oral sex on him. And once again once he was done he hopped up and  
00:09:54.410 but that's the last I saw of him at that party. It's like when she's down he's out mm-hmm so.
00:10:00.590 Sometimes before the some of the things that I noticed that we're weird with him  
00:10:07.640 well sometimes before the parties he would come over and him Jeffrey Epstein and himself would  
00:10:15.680 kind of banter back and forth and he was very ---Donald Trump was very racist. He said a lot  
00:10:19.850 of racist things. Like there was there was a lot of comments towards Mr. Epstein about you  
00:10:25.940 know being Jewish and in comments 'you bastard', you know, so that he was cheap and there was some  
00:10:33.230 words I didn't even understand --- something about the shape of his penis being directly  
00:10:41.600 related to his mole or I'm not too familiar with did you know the Jewish tradition so but  
00:10:49.270 I'm pretty sure that whatever he was saying wasn't very nice. Also referred to, you know,  
00:10:54.970 people of Hispanic or you know Hispanic me and he called them spics. That was around  
00:11:03.430 the first time that the World Trade Center had gotten the bombing in the 90s and he was  
00:11:09.940 you know talking about the towelheads and how you know it would just be better off if we you  
00:11:14.140 know I didn't let him in or you know basically got rid of everyone every single one that was  
00:11:19.030 already here. And I thought I just that was it made me really uncomfortable really really  
00:11:24.070 uncomfortable. He also loved to call black people niggers, and Arabic people he called sand makers.
00:11:33.640 The only time that that he tried to give me some money was the last our last encounter together  
00:11:44.590 where he acted out a rape fantasy. I just I was forced to I was forced to give that money back,  
00:11:56.830 because I Jeffrey Epstein paid us after the party so but he just gave me the money. I  
00:12:05.290 don't even know why he gave it to me maybe didn't make me feel more cheap but it was  
00:12:09.580 um it was a pretty bright I will it was a rape fantasy to him but I'd if I wasn't playing so.
00:12:15.610 There was those there was those two times and then there was after and the next the next thing that  
00:12:21.970 was that a Tiffany approached me with was that he had a fantasy where he walked in on his maids  
00:12:31.690 basically making out and that he it was some type of fantasy for him. So she asked I mean  
00:12:38.620 I was at that point I was like I don't want to be involved with anything that has to do  
00:12:42.850 with him. But she's like you were just basically the the other one so there's nothing that you'll  
00:12:47.920 have to do just don't you know just you want he's requesting you to be involved. So I reluctantly  
00:12:56.120 I felt like I didn't have a choice there but it was basically he's walking in his two maids I  
00:13:04.250 was one of the main so I was the white maid and there was a Spanish girl Maria who was Hispanic  
00:13:11.300 maid and we were making out and he walks in and he gets really angry and threatens to send call  
00:13:21.830 immigration on Maria if she doesn't come over and make things right and give him a blow job.  
00:13:26.210 So while she is over there giving him a blow job I am just look trying to you know I'm supposed  
00:13:35.540 to look scared like oh no you know and cleaning tried cleaning up things and pretending like I'm  
00:13:41.810 trying to go back to my job as a maid and then he his being was so rude to Maria I felt so bad for  
00:13:49.070 her even though I guess it just didn't seem like a fantasy and it didn't seem like it's the weirdest  
00:13:58.310 fantasy as far as that. You know he was threatened he was threatening to call immigration on her yes  
00:14:04.700 so that she know how to you know she went to she wasn't even near going down to give him perform  
00:14:12.800 oral sex on him before he slapped her away and said you know you what are you doing you know you  
00:14:17.090 need to put a condom on and and she's trying to miss me and I'm so sorry and he's like you can't  
00:14:23.750 even can't you understand what you're saying you know and just, you know. 'speak English',  
00:14:27.800 you know he called her derogatory comments and then he's like 'you know what, you don't know what  
00:14:35.570 you're doing. have her come over and show you how it's done'. And so, I again I said that I didn't  
00:14:45.380 you know I had to go over there or else he was going to call immigration on Maria I didn't know  
00:14:51.260 if it was true or not, but I felt that you know he said that if I was if I didn't show her how to  
00:14:56.840 perform oral sex on him then he was going to call immigration on her and then get rid of us both.
00:15:05.430 You know it was anything that was in relation to him getting off or being satisfied or happy  
00:15:12.600 had to do with him being in power but extreme power. And it's it's very it's very hard to  
00:15:21.780 even it was it was always intimidating when he was like that. It was always you didn't really  
00:15:28.200 know if it was true or funny. It's like if you refuse to play along would he really  
00:15:34.320 call immigration on Maria? Would he really get rid of us both. And I didn't even want to know  
00:15:40.020 what that meant. You know I always didn't --- it wasn't a game. We just felt like it wasn't a game.
00:15:46.230 The one night that I had the blonde wig on, he mentioned that I looked like, you know,  
00:15:52.290 I looked like to you know that I reminded him of his daughter. And actually the the the maid  
00:15:59.760 fantasy I didn't have a blonde wig on. And I was trying to stay away from blond wigs  
00:16:04.410 at the time. But he actually requested -- told Tiffany that that's when he wanted me to wear  
00:16:09.090 like he wanted in these and anytime I put it on anytime I had it on and he'd see me would  
00:16:15.240 say oh man you look just and it wasn't like a oh you remind me of my daughter it was a sick  
00:16:19.950 evil like mmm you remind me of my daughter. It was just this weird pleasure sick smile like I don't  
00:16:29.550 even want to know what he was thinking about. I could imagine what he was thinking about.
00:16:32.880 After the parties would end, we were to a report to Mr. Epstein and basically tell  
00:16:40.050 him everything that happened with who what they liked what they disliked if  
00:16:46.230 there was any requests if there was any talk about anything. That's what when  
00:16:52.350 we told Mr. Epstein everything and then he paid us and then we got to go home.
00:16:57.000 And with me you know I would either you know I normally got taken taken  
00:17:03.840 to the airport you know so to go back home.
00:17:06.420 The fact that Trump has a chance to be the next president makes me feel disgusting inside. I've  
00:17:14.369 always been proud to be an American, and I think we live in a beautiful country. But I just see  
00:17:21.630 him ruining everything. He's a horrible what he portrays on the outside isn't even that great,  
00:17:29.370 but people don't even know the half of it -- how evil help sick and twisted that man is.
00:17:33.810 I have a friend that's been my friend ever since the school year that I stopped going, you know,  
00:17:42.780 the the eighth grade. I confided in her and she knows all about it. She knows everything  
00:17:49.200 I mean I I destroyed everything like you know any planes - I didn't I couldn't risk it my my  
00:17:57.000 dad finding out. And now I think I'm old enough to where I think I don't think you know I at  
00:18:05.280 that point I didn't want to not be his little girl, you know, I didn't want to lose my dad.
00:18:11.220 Basically I I any I would never as far as keeping proof of any of the trips and the  
00:18:18.450 only person.... I never told my parents you know I there would be no happy you know there  
00:18:24.090 would be no good outcome of telling my parents, you know, they would have grounded me I would  
00:18:30.090 have never been allowed of the house, you know, my father would have come unglued. I did tell a  
00:18:36.780 friend my best she's still my best friend of this day. She knows everything. She knows it  
00:18:41.190 all. I'm prepared to do whatever it takes to save the country that I believe that we have.
00:18:49.200 I know when he does behind pub-like closed doors like if that's all I'm  
00:18:55.380 willing to sacrifice my life to put our country back - and they're right like  
00:19:00.390 going maybe in some type of positive direction not even there's no right  
00:19:03.840 or wrong but a positive direction. This guy's not gonna take us anywhere positive.
00:19:07.140 You know as far as my life changing by coming out of his information I've thought long and  
00:19:13.560 hard about whether or not I should. And I've gone back and forth, but I think that I can't I think  
00:19:25.180 that the American people need to know what kind of man this person is. And if my life changes  
00:19:32.470 because of that. then so be it but the American people need to know what they're dealing with.
00:19:38.170 If I had the chance to talk to Donald Trump I would run the other way. I'm  
00:19:43.060 scared of him like I've never been scared of him anything else in my  
00:19:48.640 entire life. I can't I can't explain it to you, but I just the fear of him  
00:19:56.380 even being in the next room may I have a panic I would have had a panic attacks.
00:20:02.440 The last encounter that I had with Donald Trump --- Tiffany approached me about a rape scene that  
00:20:13.300 was he's supposed to be played out and I didn't like I didn't like the sound of that at all,  
00:20:21.250 but Tiffany promised ensured me that it wasn't going to be if I if it was anything I wasn't  
00:20:26.710 comfortable with we could stop. That she would be right there and that and would it wouldn't get  
00:20:33.820 out of it wouldn't get out of hand and that it was just it was a fantasy like it wasn't really gonna  
00:20:39.760 happen. And so she I told her that I would she she basically I mean she Tiffany was always nice  
00:20:48.520 to me. I felt I trusted her else I will you know and I wouldn't always trusted her or done what  
00:20:56.230 she asked me to but she was there. And he came in and I was basically tied to a bed with pantyhose,  
00:21:06.550 and he tied him I knew they were so tied I could it hurt to even like lay there and I tried to you  
00:21:16.270 know try to say something it was like and he's just 'shut up' and 'shut up bitch',  
00:21:20.980 you know, this is it was basically like he was he was being really really rough, and  
00:21:25.300 I understand that I don't I mean it just didn't seem like a fantasy, and I started to get scared,  
00:21:32.900 and and he was you know basically like ripping my clothes off, and and I was actually real I  
00:21:39.560 started I got freaked out I I told him that I don't want to do this. I was, you know,  
00:21:45.080 I screamed over for Tiffany and she was like Mr. Trump she's only you know she's not she this is  
00:21:51.680 scaring her and he's like 'oh, you shut up, too' - he just turned in this animal. It was a completely  
00:21:56.180 different completely different person. It was like everyone in the room was scared of him and -- I  
00:22:05.270 was --- it was like a I couldn't do anything about it. And he ripped off all my clothes and  
00:22:28.670 he started to basically have sex with me and I was screaming, because I never had sex before was my  
00:22:39.800 first time and Tiffany was yelling at him too she she was saying I was a virgin and he's told us to  
00:22:47.420 'just shut the fuck up' and just basically took my virginity while I was crying and telling him  
00:22:54.050 to stop and that's basically begging for him to just stop. And Tiffany didn't know what else to  
00:23:03.530 do either she no one was there to help us -- or me. And so so after the fact and he he he  
00:23:19.280 basically finishes it and didn't it didn't take that long at all I mean but it was just it felt  
00:23:26.300 like it was like five and a half hours well it was an eternity like I don't even know how long it was  
00:23:30.740 but he was done and I was crying and Tiffany was consulting me. And she was you know apologizing.  
00:23:38.990 She told me that she would never she didn't she just never put me in that situation again. But  
00:23:47.210 he comes over mad because I was crying -- he said that I should be thankful that someone like Donald  
00:23:53.090 Trump took my virginity. Well he didn't say took my virginity he said I should be glad that someone  
00:23:59.930 like Donald Trump pop my cherry and not some pimply little 14 year old. And I just was like  
00:24:08.840 what if I yeah I said what if I get pregnant not even talking to him. I didn't want to talk to him.  
00:24:13.550 I was talking to Tiffany. And he said well you'll get an abortion then bitch and then just walked  
00:24:18.380 away and I I asked I went to I had told Tiffany I needed to go home. I never went back again.
00:24:34.450 I guess I guess it's for you to decide. You know I mean if I don't have any kids myself because  
00:24:46.570 I'm afraid to have kids because and who knows what kind of damage they can get into. But if you have  
00:24:53.380 a 13 year old daughter and you're I mean would you be okay with the person who's running our  
00:24:59.110 country doing that to your little girl? And I just I don't know I just want people to know. I think  
00:25:08.800 that I I haven't I know I have a faith in our in our society that will make the right choice.
00:25:13.450 He seemed to be taking great pleasure and like dominance and control and just  
00:25:20.650 the more I screamed the more I got scared the more he was enraged and  
00:25:25.900 like power enraged with power. And it was like he was just charged with it was scary.
00:25:37.570 My experience with Donald Trump and has made it to where I I can't be in a healthy relationship  
00:25:49.900 much less I can't be in a relationship without without my self sabotaging it. I don't I don't  
00:26:00.100 do well --- I mean I've been in I've been in a couple of relationships I mean they're never of  
00:26:08.050 interest to me normally but one in particular that was a wonderful --- he was a wonderful  
00:26:13.300 man --- and I completely knowing I I had like subconsciously I couldn't even control myself  
00:26:19.900 it was like I had to get him out of my life because you know I don't I don't know why. It  
00:26:25.900 was like anytime anyone loves me I don't feel worth it or you know I've I mean I've I don't  
00:26:38.750 even know how to explain it. Like I can't friends I can have acquaintances that you guys that are  
00:26:44.840 acquaintances but I just you know anytime it's maybe someone expressed anything else besides  
00:26:51.410 that I can't --- I take some type of pleasure and not some type of I don't take pleasure in it but  
00:26:58.040 subconsciously whether I mean to or not sometimes I've meant to it's like I hurt their feelings just  
00:27:06.410 so they'll never talk to me again. Like and make sure that it's not ever a possibility.
00:27:11.330 Donald Trump, Donald Trump destroyed my feeling of self-worth and my self-esteem when  
00:27:20.660 it was still --- I like when it just bloomed. It hadn't even had a chance to experience anything.
00:27:27.470 I have I have only spoken to to one therapist about this just recently actually I for a long  
00:27:39.440 time I just really just tried to forget about it. Just tried very hard. But I've been to counseling  
00:27:46.430 for other things, and I went to counseling for the previous the previous relationship  
00:27:52.790 that I was sabotaging. And my counselor said something has happened to you that were you  
00:27:56.660 or just you need to deal with that. That's actually what kind of was like hmm. He knew  
00:28:01.700 that there was something that had happened where I was self sabotaging or you know sabotaging these  
00:28:06.320 relationships. But, you know, he said that it was my responsibility to deal with it, of course.
00:28:14.120 This the situation with Donald Trump has left it just destroyed my self-esteem and  
00:28:20.390 it's made it to where I feel like it's destroyed part of  
00:28:23.840 my life. I haven't --- the only healthy relationship I've completely demolished.  
00:28:30.200 And I love to choose the dysfunctional ones that I know I can just push away.
00:28:37.580 After what happened with him I can't trust a  
00:28:45.710 man ever again. I --- thinking about it just makes me sick to my stomach.
00:28:55.340 So when when something so traumatic happens to someone that's so young,  
00:29:02.090 you never ever really get over it
